# 3D Animation and Interactive Camera in Your React Project with Three.js

This project demonstrates how to integrate 3D animation, interactive camera movement, and real-time object interaction in a React application using Three.js and React Three Fiber.
You’ll learn how to build 3D components, apply lighting, enable smooth animations, and create mouse-based interactions such as drag-to-rotate.

🚀 Tech Stack
Vite.js — Fast build tool for modern web development
Three.js — Core 3D rendering engine
React Three Fiber (R3F) — React renderer for Three.js
